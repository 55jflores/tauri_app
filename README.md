This template should help get you started developing with Tauri and React in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

Front-end portion of this application was made with React

I called the NASA API through Rust and passed up the values to React to display the image and text alongside it
